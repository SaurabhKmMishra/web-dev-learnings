## üß† First, What is Synchronous Code in JavaScript?

JavaScript **is single-threaded and synchronous by default**, which means:

* It runs **one line at a time**, **in order**, from top to bottom.
* It **waits** for each line to finish before moving to the next.

Example:

```js
console.log("Start");
console.log("Middle");
console.log("End");
```

‚û°Ô∏è Output:

```
Start
Middle
End
```

---

## üîÅ Then, What is Asynchronous Code?

Asynchronous code allows certain tasks to **run in the background** (like waiting for a response, delay, or file), and **continue executing the rest of the code without waiting**.

Example:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

‚û°Ô∏è Output:

```
Start
End
Inside setTimeout
```

Even though `setTimeout` is written second, its callback runs later.

## üß© Why This Happens: The Event Loop, Call Stack & Web APIs

### Let's understand the behind-the-scenes mechanism:

### 1. **Call Stack**:

* A place where all the function calls go.
* Follows **LIFO** (Last In, First Out).
* It processes **synchronous** code.

Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
greet();
```

* `greet()` is pushed to the call stack.
* Executes `console.log`.
* Then it's popped out.

---

### 2. **Web APIs (Provided by the Browser)**:

* `setTimeout`, `fetch`, DOM events, etc. are not handled by JavaScript **itself**, but by the **browser** (like Chrome).
* They run **outside** the main thread.

So when you call:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timer done");
}, 2000);
```

Here's what happens:

1. `setTimeout` is sent to the browser's Web API.
2. After 2 seconds, the callback `() => { console.log("Timer done"); }` is moved to the **callback queue**.

---

### 3. **Callback Queue / Task Queue**:

* This is where asynchronous callbacks wait their turn.

---

### 4. **Event Loop**:

This is the magic!

The **event loop constantly checks**:

üëâ Is the call stack empty?
‚úÖ If yes ‚Üí It takes the first thing from the callback queue and pushes it to the call stack to run.

So:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside Timeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

üß† Internally:

* `Start` ‚Üí goes to call stack ‚Üí runs.
* `setTimeout` ‚Üí sent to Web API ‚Üí waits 2 seconds.
* `End` ‚Üí goes to call stack ‚Üí runs.
* After 2 seconds ‚Üí callback moves to callback queue.
* Event Loop sees the call stack is empty ‚Üí pushes it to stack ‚Üí `Inside Timeout` runs.

---

## üí• So How Does JS "Simultaneously" Balance Async?

It **doesn‚Äôt** really run in parallel.
It just **delegates async tasks** to the browser (or Node.js APIs) and **keeps going**.

* The main thread runs sync code.
* Async code runs elsewhere (in browser APIs).
* Event loop and queues make sure everything gets handled **without blocking**.

---

## üéØ Real World Analogy (Caf√© Style):

* You (JS thread) take orders (synchronous code).
* A customer orders a coffee that takes time (setTimeout/fetch).
* You pass it to the barista (Web API).
* You continue serving other customers (rest of your code).
* When the coffee is ready, the barista lets you know (callback queue).
* You serve it (event loop pushes it to stack).

---

## üß™üß† Bonus Tip: Promises & Async/Await

Promises and `async/await` are also **asynchronous**, but they use a different queue called the **microtask queue** ‚Äî it gets priority over the regular callback queue.

Example:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));

console.log("End");
```

‚û°Ô∏è Output:

```
Start
End
Promise
Timeout
```

Even with `0ms` delay, the Promise runs first ‚Äî microtasks run **before** setTimeout.

## ‚úÖ Summary:

| Component       | Role                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call Stack      | Runs synchronous code line-by-line                      |
| Web APIs        | Handles async tasks (like setTimeout, fetch)            |
| Callback Queue  | Holds async callbacks waiting to be executed            |
| Event Loop      | Moves callbacks to the call stack when it‚Äôs empty       |
| Microtask Queue | Special queue for Promises (runs before callback queue) |
