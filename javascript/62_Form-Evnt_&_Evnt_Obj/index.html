    <h1>Form Events and Event Object</h1>

    <form action="/search" method="get">

    <input type="text" id="username" name="username">
    <input type="text" id="email" name="email">

    <button>click Me</button>

    </form>

    <p>hi</p>
    
    <!-- The submit button by default when clicked in a form creates a dynamic URL using action, name and i/p done by the user. -->

    <!-- Whereas in terms of js it fires a submit event -->
    
    <!-- ðŸ”¶Important Attributes of form tag -->

    <!-- ðŸ”¹action: Where to send form data (usually a URL or server file).	for ex: action="submit.php" -->

    <!-- ðŸ”¹method: How to send the data. GET (visible in URL) or POST (hidden in URL).	 for ex: method="post" or "get" -->


    <!--ðŸ”¹ What happens when we click Submit?
        âœ” Data from inputs is packaged.
        âœ” Sent to the server page defined in action.
        âœ” Method (GET or POST) decides how data travels.
        
    > we can add click, focus, blur, change, etc events on several tags inside the form.

    > But âœ” Only the <form> tag can handle the 'submit' event and also the rest all of the events possible.   
    
    > âœ… "The button inside the form with no type (or type='submit') causes the form to fire its submit event when clicked â€” but the button itself does not directly fire a submit event. Itâ€™s the form that does."    

    > Also, the by default value of button type is 'submit'.
    
    > ðŸŽ¯ By setting type="button", this button will NOT submit the form at all â€” even if it is inside the form. 
    
    > ðŸŽ¯ Also if we wants to stop form submission using JS logic? Use event.preventDefault() in submit event listener or click event listener.

    > ðŸŽ¯ The type="reset" in a <button> is used to clear all form fields â€” setting them back to their default values (the values they had when the page loaded or the form was last reset).
