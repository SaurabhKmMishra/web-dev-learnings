    <h1>CallStack :> It is a mechanism through which the javascript engine tracks its location that in which line or function/Execution Context it is at present. 

    </br></br>

    :> the very first element in the call stack is the global(anonymous) viz. the representation of the global execution context(GEC) of the whole js file.

   </br></br>

    :>And it is based on lifo (last in first out) scheme where the lastly added element is refered as the present location indicated by the arrow. </br></br>

    :> this arror indicates that the present location is contained in the blocks/functions down the stack.

   </br></br>
    
   :> with the completion of the respective function calls the callStack deletes their records of execution contexts from it and one the whole script is executed the callStack gets to be empty.
